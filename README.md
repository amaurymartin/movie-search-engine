Coding Challenge - Movie Search Engine

You will be building a movie search engine backend API with Ruby on Rails. The app will expose a REST API.

You can use the [Movie DB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) to get movie data. For the scope of this exercise, we will only get data from only one source, but in the future we would want to add multiple sources of data (ie, we might want to add books, music albums, etc.).

Hereâ€™s an API key you can use:
```
  AAFE81E4392B31C292DCDEBE182BF4D99C2DF6E86FFBCC1796D1139CD141B6B977B1C55D2052BE5EE5DCE5527DDD19AC
```

The user of the api can pass a text query and the API endpoint should return a list of matching movies.
You should write tests for your code.
